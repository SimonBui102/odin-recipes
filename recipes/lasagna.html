            1. Lasagna Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (1/2 pound ground pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar</strong>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
            <li>
                <strong>Noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
            </li>
        </ul>
